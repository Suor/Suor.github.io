Here are some things Reform plug-in for Sublime Text 2 and 3 is capable of.


### Navigation

You can move up and down by function declarations and blocks of code. You can also jump to a word identical to the one at cursor: nice way to jump between imports, declarations and several variable uses.

Select blocks of code, function and class scopes. Delete block of code with surrounding empty lines. Select all name occurrences in a function scope.
