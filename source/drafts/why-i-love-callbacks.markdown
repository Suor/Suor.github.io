Node.js brought asynchronous programming to common use and popular thinking. It also made callbacks much more widespread then ever before. And while there are alternatives like promises and coroutines, callbacks remain basic and by far most popular approach to async programming, at least in Node.js.

In recent years the concept of async programming has become popular. This is mostly related to the rise of Node.js, but such technologies as Go, Erlang, Twisted, EventMachine, asyncio and more also contributed. There are a variety of approaches to async programming: callbacks, green threads,actors and CSP.
