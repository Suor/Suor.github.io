There are many reasons people use best practices ...


## The good parts

<!-- **Canned wisdom**. Transferable -->

**Can be taught**. Every best practice is much more than an off-the-shelf solution for common problem. It has name, examples, literature behind it. It is basically a canned wisdom prepared to be transferable and easily consumed.

**No need to be understood**. One of the greatest powers of best practices is that you can start using them before you completely understand where they came from or what are their benefits. In ideal world we all should know what we are doing and why. But in reality you need some time to understand a thing and even more to internalize it. And starting using it right now is a great way to make sense of it.

**Higher average level**. Just a consequence of first two, but important enough to stress it. Easy transfer and early stage engagement make best practices widespread and, since they represent good solutions, this raises overall quality.

**Bring standardization**. Another consequence of widespread use. This essentially reduces entropy and hence cognitive load. Even when there are two good solutions, it's easier if everyone just always go with first.

**No need to think**. Saves time and mental energy. Worries, trouble. Saves from worries of choice and a trouble of bad one.


## And the bad ones

**

**Inertia**. Personal, social.

**Can be broken**. Or misunderstood, or misused.

**Undefined scope**. Or poorly defined, or implicitly global.

Holy wars. Unneeded attachment -> inertia?

Cargo cult


## When to break one?
